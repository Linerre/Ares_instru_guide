# ARes Guide For Instructors

*This is work in progress. *

This Instructional Guide introduces **ARes** (short for **A**utomated **R**eserves). 

The targed users are instructors who, after reading or by the help of, this guide will be able and supposed to submit their course reserve requests through ARes and through ARes only whenever applicapable. 

The .zip contains all the `LaTeX` files to make out the `PDF` file. 

All the other files are indeed from the .zip but subject to change soon.
